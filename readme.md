# Python Project Template

Welcome to **python-project-template**! This is a starting point for a new Python project in our organization.

This repository is a template designed to help developers quickly set up a new Python project with best practices and standardized configurations using Cookiecutter. 

## Project Purpose

This template serves as a flexible starting point for creating Python-based projects, whether for application development, data science, or other Python-focused tasks. With this template, users can generate a new project directory structure complete with essential files, configurations, and documentation templates. This allows developers to maintain consistency and quality across multiple projects.

## How It Works

This project template uses **Cookiecutter**, a tool for creating new projects from templates. With Cookiecutter, users can generate a new project by filling out a few prompts, which will then populate predefined values in the template. The generated project includes:

- Standardized project structure
- Pre-configured `dockerfile` for containerized development
- Dependency management files (`requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`)
- Basic directory setup for `src`, `tests`, and more

## Getting Started

To generate a new project based on this template, you will need to have **Cookiecutter** installed. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can do so using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Once installed, you can create a new project by running the following command and following the prompts:

```bash
cookiecutter /path/to/this/python-project-template
```

Replace /path/to/this/template with the path to this template directory or the Git repository URL if the template is hosted online.

## Project Structure
The generated project will include the following structure:

```bash
{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/
.
├── .created_from
├── CodeOwner
├── README.md
├── datas
├── dockerfile
├── docs
├── envs
│   ├── environment.yml
│   └── requirements.txt
├── examples
├── src
│   ├── backend
│   │   ├── api.py
│   │   └── {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
│   └── frontend
└── tests
    ├── integration
    └── unitary
        └── __init__.py
```

- dockerfile: Configuration for Docker to containerize the application.
- envs/: Environment configuration files to manage dependencies.
- src/: Source code directory for application development.
- tests/: Directory for unit and integration tests.


## Running the Generated Project
After generating the project, follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Set up the environment: Use the requirements.txt or environment.yml to create your Python environment.

2. Build and run the Docker container (if applicable):

    ```bash
    docker build -t your_project_name .
    docker run your_project_name
    ```

This template aims to help you start your Python projects quickly, maintain consistency, and follow best practices effortlessly.
